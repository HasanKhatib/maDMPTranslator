Furthermore, in the second part of the experiment, it is analyzed the origin of the Erasmus students coming to Austria from other countries in Europe regarding the grant in euros that they receive, the age, the number of ECTS that they enrol and the gender, characterizing these features in box plots to represent the distribution of the samples.",
